## 0.0.7

### Breaking Changes

-   Updated clap dependency to version 4.5.11: Dependency updates can sometimes
    introduce breaking changes if the new version is not backward compatible.

    the clap update, this could introduce breaking changes if the new version of
    tokio is not backward compatible.

    support: Major refactoring often introduces breaking changes, especially if
    the public API or expected behavior changes.

    function to async can be a breaking change if users were not expecting this
    and need to adjust their code accordingly.

    async support: Refactoring for type safety and async support can introduce
    breaking changes if the function signatures or expected usage patterns
    change.
