## 0.0.7

### Breaking Changes

-   Updated `clap` dependency to version 4.5.11: Dependency updates can
    sometimes introduce breaking changes if the new version is not backward
    compatible.

    the `clap` update, this could introduce breaking changes if the new version
    of `tokio` is not backward compatible.

    support: Major refactoring often introduces breaking changes, especially if
    the public API or expected behavior changes.

    function to async can be a breaking change if users were not expecting this
    and need to adjust their code accordingly.
-   Refactored `Source/Struct/Binary/Command.rs` for improved type safety and
    async support: Refactoring for type safety and async support can introduce
    breaking changes if the function signatures or expected usage patterns
    change.

### Added

-   New `.cargo/Config.toml` file with build and profile configurations
-   Added `futures = "0.3.30"` dependency
